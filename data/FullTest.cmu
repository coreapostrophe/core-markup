# Basic Ways of Representing Information

## Basic Ways of Representing Information

* Analog and Digital
- distinguished by the nature of the values that they allow information variables to asssume

* Analog Quantities
- Information that can vary over a continuous range of values.

* Digital Quantities
- Information that is represented by a fixed number of discrete symbols called digits.

$ Advantages of Digital Techniques
- Digital system design is easier
- Information storage is easy
- Greater precision and accuracy
- Programmability
- Less susceptible to noise
- Digital circuitry can be fabricated on IC chips

$ Limitation of Digital Techniques
- The real world is mainly analog

## Data Representation

### Number Systems and Base Conversion

$ Base-r to Decimal
-$ 1. Multiply each coefficient with the corresponding power of r
-- 1.1. For the integer part, power of r goes from 0 to n-1 where n is the number of digits in the integer part
-- 1.2. For the fractional part, power of r goes from -1 to -m where m is the number of digits in the fractional part
- 2. Get the sum

$ Decimal to Base-r
-  1. Split the number into its integer part and its fractional part.
-$ 2. Convert integer part to base-r
-- 2.1. Divide the integer by r. Accumulate the remainders
-- 2.2. Repeat step 2.1 until quotient is already equal to zero
-$ 3. Convert fractional part to base-r
-- 3.1. Multiply the fraction by r. Accumulate the integers of the product.
-- 3.2. Repeat step 3.1 until the fractional part of the product is already equal to zero or sufficient accuracy is achieved.

$ Binary to Octal
- 1. Partition the binary number into groups of 3 digits
- 2. Convert each group to its equivalent decimal value

$ Binary to Hexadecimal
- 1. Partition the binary number into groups of 4 digits
- 2. Convert each group to its equivalent decimal value

$ Octal to Binary
- 1. Convert each octal digit to its 3-digit binary equivalent

$ Hexadecimal to Binary
- 1. Convert each Hexadecimal digit to its 4-digit binary equivalent

### Negative Number Representations


$ Signed-Magnitude Representation
- A number consists of a magnitude and a symbol indicating whether the magnitude is Positive or Negative.

$ Signed-Complement Representation
- This system negates a number by taking its complement as defined by the system.
-$ Types of Complements
--$ Radix-complement
--- General Formula r's C of N = r^n - N
--$ Diminished Radix-Complement
--- General Formula (r-1)'s C of N = (r^n-r^-m) - N

### Binary and Alphanumeric Codes

* Code
- A set of n-bit strings in which differnet bit strings represent different numbers or other things

$ Binary Codes are used for
- Decimal numbers
- Character codes

$ Some Binary Codes
- BCD (Binary-coded decimal)
- Excess-3
- Biquinary

#### Binary Codes for Decimal numbers

$ BCD (Binary-coded decimal)
- Straight assignment of the binary equivalent
- Weights can be assigned to 

$ Excess-3 Code
- Unweighted code (BCD + 3)

$ Biquinary Code
- Seven-bit code with error detection properties
- Each decimal digit consists of 5 0's and 2 1'significant

$ Differences between Binary and BCD
- BCD is not a number system
- BCD requires more bits than Binary
- BCD is less efficient than Binary
- BCD is easier to use than Binary

$ Coding vs Conversion
-* Conversion
-- bits obtained are binary digits
-* Coding
-- bits obtained are combinations of 0's and 1's

##### Coding Systems

$ Examples of Binary Coding Systems
- Gray Code
- Character Code

$ Gray Code
- A coding system where two successive values differ in only one digit to prevent spurious output from electromechanical switches

$ Character Code
-$ American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)
-- 7-bit code
-- contains 94 graphic characters and 34 non-printing characters
-$ Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code
-- 8-bit code
-- used mainly by IBM machines

### Fixed and Floating Point Representations

$ Things to be noted
- No representation method is capable of representing all real numbers
- Most real values must be represented by an approximation

$ Various Number Systems
- Fixed-point number system
- Rational number system
- Floating point number system
- Logarithmic number system

* Fixed-point Representation 
- It is a method used to represent numbers with fixed number of digits

$ Fixed Point Representation
-* Unsigned Number
-- leftmost bit is the most significant bit
-* Signed Number
-- leftmost bit represents the sign

$ Disadvantages of Fixed-point Representation
- very small real numbers are not clearly distinguished
- very large real numbers are not known accurately enough

* Floating-point Representation
- It is a method used to represent real numbers
- Notation mantissa x base ^ exponent
