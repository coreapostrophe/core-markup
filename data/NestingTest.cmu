$Signed-Complement Representation
-This system negates a number by taking its complement as defined by the system.

-$Types of Complements

--$Radix-complement
---General Formula: r's C of N = r^n - N

----$Radix-complement
-----General Formula: r's C of N = r^n - N

--$Diminished Radix-Complement
---General Formula: (r-1)'s C of N = (r^n-r^-m) - N
